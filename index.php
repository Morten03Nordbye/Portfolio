                <p> I completed a year-long education in electro. Through this program, I learned about the principles of electricity and electronics. I also had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and build my own circuits and devices. The education has given me a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie technology. I am excited to apply this knowledge in my future studies and career. </p>
